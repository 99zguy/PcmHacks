This is a work-in-progress that only exists to experiment with object-oriented design ideas.

When the design is reasonable, we'll make it into something actually usable.

Open issues:

Should Port.Recieve return a byte[] rather than taking one as a parameter?

Should MessageFactory / MessageParser be replaced by a collection of classes that each know how to generate and parse a particular type of message?
