This is a work in progress.

Our goal is to be able to read and write the contents of GM Powertrain Control Modules, such as the 0411.

Current read functionality requires a flash kernel in c:\kernel.bin.
This file will be released later, and its load will be streamlined.

For now see the /Apps/PcmHammer subdirectory for the flash tool work-in-progress.
