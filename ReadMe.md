This is a work in progress.

Our goal is to be able to read and write the contents of GM Powertrain Control Modules, such as the 12200411 and other members of the P01 and P59 families.

Reading is working well. Writing is working well enough to try it on your project car, but you probably shouldn't try writing with your daily driver until this software has proven itself a little more.
